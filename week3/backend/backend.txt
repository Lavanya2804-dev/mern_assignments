HTTP Server--->APIs---->Database

HTTP Server: 
    -It is a server that accepts requests and sends responses.[HTTPRequests,HTTPResponse]
    -It cannot handle database operations.
    -HTTP server should be on state and have a port number.
    -HTTP Protocol is used to communicate between HTTP Server and APIs.

APIs: Application Programming Interfaces.
      -APIs have process to requests but cannot receive requests.
      -An Application can have multiple APIs.
      -APIs contains request handling mechanisms.
      -Protocol between API and database depends on the database used.
      -APIs are used to connect the database to the web application.
      -Handling,Authentication and Authorization are done in APIs.

Database: 
    -It is a collection of data stored in a structured way.
    -It is used to store and retrieve data.
    -Indexing is needed .

**tcp connection will be estimated that the  http request invokes
**client-->fronend application
**http-->receives the request but cant process.
         it receives the request and  gives to the API
**API-->can processes the request but cannot receive the request
        API-application program interface
        Handle the request
        can communicate to the database
**REST API-->representational state transfer API
            An endpoint is a url where your API can be accessed to perform the
            specific operations on resources

                                    ====end point=====
            https://api.example.com/users/123 
            ======Base url========//=====//===ID
                                      ||
                                    resource

**buy using this base url any one can access 
**endpoint contains resources
**Rest APIs is a resource based API

======REST END POINT RULES======

Rule 1: use nouns,not verbs
        GOOD-----using nouns + HTTP methods
                    GET/users
                    POST/users
                    DELETE/users/123

Rule 2: use plural nouns
        GOOD-----plural
                GET/users
                GET/users/123

Rule 3: use lowercase & hypens
        GOOD-----lowcase with hypens
                GET/users
                GET/user-profile

npm install -g nodemon         -g===>globally  , mon===>monitor

It restarts automatically again when any changes happens in the code

GET--->client get the resource
POST--->client send the resource
PUT--->client asking the server to update(or)modify anything in the data

**the data b/w the applications It can be forworded in json
